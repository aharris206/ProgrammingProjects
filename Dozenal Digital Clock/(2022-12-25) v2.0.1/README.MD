# Version 2.0.1 - 2022-12-25T21:03âˆ’08:00 - (PST)
`HUGE` Upgrade to the previous `1.0.X` series that used pictures to display the digits.
This version `finally` shows the digits as LEDs like how I had in mind.
# It's Scallable too!
One of the `other` major benefits of using the `S`calable `V`ector `G`raphics format is that it can be scalled!
This version `2.0.1` is the first to implement the scalability of the format!
`indev`.html stands for `In Development`. . . I got the idea from Minecraft (:
I got it working JUST before midnight too!
